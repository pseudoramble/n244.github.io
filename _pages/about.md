Welcome to N244 or, as it was more affectionately known as, The Lounge. We are a group of 
developers who met at the University of New Hampshire during our time as Computer Science students. 
During our stint, we spent many days and even more nights together in Kingsbury Hall room N244, which 
was the lounge for Computer Science students. We have all moved on from UNH, some continuing education
elsewhere and others beginning our very different careers in the computer industry. These are their 
stories. Chung chung.
