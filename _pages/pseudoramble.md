A short bit about myself: I attended The University of New Hampshire (UNH) where I obtained my BS in Computer Science. And yes, N244 ("The Lounge") is where I spent much of my time. I think the amount of time spend there increased at roughly `O(2^n)`, though it doesn't seem like the program to test that idea has terminated yet. 

After UNH, my professional life after has been working as a front-end software developer (along with RESTful services here and there). My main language of use here is Javascript (ES5 initially, but much more ES 6/7 recently) along with Javascript tools like React and Redux. I also dabble in HTML and CSS as I need to.

Outside of school/work life, I enjoy messing around with other programming languages. I've been most interested in F# as of recent. Originally derived from OCaml, F# is a strongly typed compiled language (with type-inference) that is mainly functional (but can also support an object-oriented style). Two features I file under "really-neat-but-I-do-not-quite-get-yet" include Type Providers and Computational Expressions. 

Outside of computer life, you might find me going on a walk/jog, on the road bike, at the gym, or perhaps reading/writing. My aim for here is to write primarily technical entries probably around programming languages I work with or am trying to learn and perhaps add a little entertainment and color to these kind of things. My hope is that you'll find these entries as enjoyable to read as I find them to write.

My colleagues and myself are all fairly diverse in terms of our technical interests, so I suspect there's something in this blog you're bound to enjoy. Please, have a look around and tell us what you think. And again, thanks for dropping in!
