My first exposure to Computer Science was a programming fundamentals course
taught in QBASIC at Pembroke Academy, my highschool, located in Pembroke, NH.
Unlike my other courses, programming was unintuitive and difficult, and I 
remember the difficulty I had with it being a major driver in my decision to 
pursue it as a major in college.

I attended the University of New Hampshire with the other contributors to N244,
earning a Bachelors degree in Computer Science with a focus on Bioinformatics
in 2012. Immediately afterward, I moved to Los Angeles, CA to pursue a PhD in
Computational Biology and Bioinformatics from the University of Southern
California (USC), where I am currently in my fourth year of a (theoretically)
five year program.

My graduate school research focuses on the design and development of tools for
analysis of next generation genetic sequencing data, with a particular emphasis
on DNA methylation analysis. Most of my day-to-day development is done in bash,
R, and C++.

If it isn't clear yet, I'm decidedly the odd duck of N244. I plan to discuss the
applications and statistical side of computer science as a field, the soft
skills it took for me to develop into a functioning biologist, and occasionally
discuss topics around graduate school in STEM.

When I'm not crunching numbers, I can be found roaming the virtual wasteland
of post-apocalyptic Massachusetts on my Playstation 4, on a weekend camping and
rock climbing trip somewhere in southern California, or wandering the streets
of Koreatown LA in search of barbecue and karaoke. 

_Projects I will get to one day:_
- A full tutorial of the various alignment algorithms I have implemented
- Webcam-mediated, cloud stored surveillance of my cats, Noodles and Cheeto
- Smartphone applications for nanopore sequencing machines
